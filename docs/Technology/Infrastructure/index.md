# Infrastructure: Building & Managing Systems at Scale

Infrastructure is the backbone of modern software and financial systems. It encompasses servers, networks, databases, storage, and all the physical and virtual resources that keep applications running.

This section explores the different infrastructure architectures used by major banks, tech companies, and enterprises—and how they manage costs effectively.

## Core Infrastructure Types

### [On-Premise Infrastructure](./On-Premise-Infrastructure)
Traditional data centers owned and operated by the company. Used extensively by JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and other banks for security and control.

### [Cloud Infrastructure](./Cloud-Infrastructure)
Managed services from AWS, Azure, GCP, and others. The modern standard for tech companies and increasingly adopted by financial institutions.

### [Hybrid Infrastructure](./Hybrid-Infrastructure)
Combination of on-premise and cloud resources. The most common setup for enterprises managing legacy systems and new applications simultaneously.

### [Infrastructure Cost Management](./Cost-Management)
Strategies, tools, and best practices for optimizing infrastructure spending without compromising performance, security, or reliability.

### [Infrastructure Comparison: Banks vs Tech Companies](./Banks-vs-Tech-Companies)
How different industries approach infrastructure differently—comparing JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.

## Why Infrastructure Matters

- **Cost Impact:** Infrastructure often represents 20-40% of an enterprise's IT budget
- **Performance:** Infrastructure decisions directly affect application speed and user experience
- **Security:** Infrastructure architecture is foundational to security posture
- **Scalability:** Good infrastructure enables growth; poor infrastructure prevents it
- **Disaster Recovery:** Infrastructure strategy determines business continuity capabilities

## Key Metrics

When evaluating infrastructure:
- **Cost per transaction** (especially critical for banks)
- **Latency** (milliseconds matter for trading, milliseconds cost millions)
- **Availability** (four-nines, five-nines, or six-nines uptime)
- **Throughput** (transactions per second)
- **TCO** (total cost of ownership over 3-5 years)
