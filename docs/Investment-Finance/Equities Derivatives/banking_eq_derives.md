# Part 1: Understanding Equities

## What is Equity? 🏠

### The Analogy: Owning a Pizza Shop

Imagine you and 3 friends open a pizza shop worth $100,000. Each of you owns 25% — that's **equity**. You're not lending money to the shop; you **own** part of it.

```
Pizza Shop Value: $100,000
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  You: 25%  │  Friend A: 25%  │  Friend B: 25%  │  Friend C: 25%  │
│  ($25,000) │    ($25,000)    │    ($25,000)    │    ($25,000)    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Now imagine the shop becomes **publicly traded** — anyone can buy a piece:

```
Pizza Shop Inc. - 100,000 shares at $1 each
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Anyone can buy shares on the stock exchange!               │
│ Buy 1,000 shares = Own 1% of the company                   │
│ Shop doubles in value? Your shares are now worth $2 each!  │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**That's what a stock is** — a tiny piece of ownership in a company.

## Key Equity Concepts

### 📊 Market Capitalization (Market Cap)

> **Definition:** The total value of all a company's shares

```
Market Cap = Share Price × Number of Shares Outstanding

Example: Apple Inc.
- Share Price: $180
- Shares Outstanding: 15.5 billion
- Market Cap: $180 × 15.5B = $2.79 Trillion 🍎
```

| Category | Market Cap | Examples |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **Mega Cap** | > $200 billion | Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon |
| **Large Cap** | $10-200 billion | Netflix, Adobe, Salesforce |
| **Mid Cap** | $2-10 billion | Etsy, Zillow |
| **Small Cap** | $300M - $2B | Regional banks, emerging companies |
| **Micro Cap** | < $300 million | Startups, penny stocks |

### 📈 Stock Indices

> **Analogy:** A stock index is like a "playlist" of stocks that represents the market

| Index | What It Tracks | Analogy |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| **S&P 500** | 500 largest US companies | The "Billboard Hot 500" of stocks |
| **Dow Jones (DJIA)** | 30 blue-chip companies | The "Hall of Fame" 30 |
| **NASDAQ** | Tech-heavy US stocks | The "Tech Playlist" |
| **Russell 2000** | 2000 small-cap stocks | The "Indie Artists" |
| **FTSE 100** | 100 largest UK companies | The "British Top 100" |
| **Nikkei 225** | 225 largest Japanese companies | Japan's "Elite 225" |

## How Investment Banks Participate in Equities

Investment banks don't just buy and sell stocks for themselves — they're the **infrastructure** of the market.

## IPO: How a Company Goes Public

### The Analogy: Selling Your Art at an Auction 🎨

You're an artist with valuable paintings. An IPO is like hiring Sotheby's to auction your art for the first time.

```
COMPANY'S IPO JOURNEY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Step 1: HIRE INVESTMENT BANKS (Underwriters)
         Company: "I want to go public!"
         Banks: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan
         
Step 2: DUE DILIGENCE & VALUATION
         Banks analyze: finances, market, growth potential
         Determine: "Your company is worth $10 billion"
         
Step 3: FILE WITH SEC (S-1 Registration)
         Public document with all company details
         🔗 SEC EDGAR Database: https://www.sec.gov/edgar
         
Step 4: ROADSHOW
         Management presents to institutional investors
         "Here's why you should buy our stock!"
         
Step 5: PRICING
         Based on investor demand, set IPO price
         Example: $50 per share, 100M shares = $5B raised
         
Step 6: LISTING DAY 🔔
         Stock starts trading on NYSE/NASDAQ
         The opening bell rings!

# Part 2: Introduction to Derivatives

## What is a Derivative? 🎭

### The Analogy: A Contract About Something Else

> **A derivative is a contract whose value is DERIVED from something else** (the "underlying asset")

Think of it like this:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                         │
│   UNDERLYING ASSET          DERIVATIVE                  │
│   (The actual thing)        (A contract about it)       │
│                                                         │
│   🏠 House                → Insurance policy            │
│   🌾 Wheat                → Futures contract            │
│   📈 Stock                → Option to buy/sell          │
│   💱 Currency             → Forward contract            │
│   📊 Interest Rate        → Swap agreement              │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Real-world analogy:** A movie ticket is like a derivative:
- The **underlying** = the movie experience
- The **derivative** = the ticket (gives you the RIGHT to see the movie)
- The ticket's value DEPENDS ON the movie's popularity

     Right, not      Obligation to    Exchange cash
     obligation      buy/sell         flows over time
```

### Quick Overview

| Type | What It Is | Analogy | Traded Where |
|------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Option** | Right (not obligation) to buy/sell | Restaurant reservation | Exchange (CBOE) |
| **Future** | Obligation to buy/sell at future date | Pre-ordering a concert ticket | Exchange (CME) |
| **Forward** | Same as future, but customized | Custom order from a tailor | OTC (Over-the-Counter) |
| **Swap** | Exchange cash flows | Trading chores with a roommate | OTC |

│  1️⃣  HEDGING (Insurance)                                        │
│      "I want to PROTECT myself from price changes"              │
│                                                                 │
│      Example: Airline buys oil futures to lock in fuel prices   │
│                                                                 │
│  2️⃣  SPECULATION (Betting)                                       │
│      "I want to PROFIT from price changes"                      │
│                                                                 │

│                                                                 │
│      Example: Buy low in one market, sell high in another       │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Futures Contracts Explained

### The Analogy: Pre-ordering a Limited Edition Sneaker 👟

You want the new Jordan sneakers releasing in 3 months at $200. You're worried the price will go up. So you sign a **contract TODAY** to buy them at $200 in 3 months, no matter what happens.

```
FUTURES CONTRACT
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TODAY (February):
- You AGREE to buy sneakers in May
- Price locked at $200
- Both parties MUST honor the contract

SCENARIO A: Sneakers retail for $300 in May
- You still pay $200 ✅
- You saved $100! 🎉

SCENARIO B: Sneakers retail for $150 in May  
- You still pay $200 ❌
- You lost $50 😢

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Real Futures Example: Oil

```
Crude Oil Futures Contract (CME)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Contract Size: 1,000 barrels
Current Price: $75 per barrel
Expiry: March 2026
Contract Value: $75 × 1,000 = $75,000

If oil goes to $80 at expiry:
- Long position profit: ($80-$75) × 1,000 = $5,000
- Short position loss: -$5,000

If oil goes to $70 at expiry:
- Long position loss: -$5,000
- Short position profit: $5,000
```

## Swaps Explained

### The Analogy: Trading Chores with Your Roommate 🏠

You hate washing dishes but don't mind vacuuming. Your roommate is the opposite. You SWAP:

```
BEFORE SWAP:
You: Dishes (hate it) + Vacuuming (okay)
Roommate: Dishes (loves it) + Vacuuming (hates it)

AFTER SWAP:
You: Vacuuming only ✅
Roommate: Dishes only ✅

Both are happier! This is a SWAP.
```

### Interest Rate Swap (Most Common)

> **The Big Idea:** Company A has a floating rate loan. Company B has a fixed rate loan. They SWAP payments.

```
INTEREST RATE SWAP EXAMPLE
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Company A (wants fixed rate):
- Has: Floating rate loan (changes with market)
- Worried: Rates might go UP

Company B (wants floating rate):
- Has: Fixed rate loan (stays same)
- Thinks: Rates might go DOWN

THE SWAP:
┌────────────┐                    ┌────────────┐
│ Company A  │ ───Fixed 5%────►   │ Company B  │
│            │ ◄──Floating LIBOR──│            │
└────────────┘                    └────────────┘

Result:
- A effectively has fixed rate (what they wanted)
- B effectively has floating rate (what they wanted)
- Both pay what they prefer!

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Types of Swaps

| Swap Type | What's Exchanged | Example Use Case |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Interest Rate Swap** | Fixed vs. Floating payments | Managing loan risk |
| **Currency Swap** | Different currency payments | International business |
| **Credit Default Swap (CDS)** | Protection against default | Insurance on bonds |
| **Total Return Swap** | Total return of an asset | Synthetic ownership |
| **Equity Swap** | Equity returns for fixed/floating | Portfolio management |

> 📊 **Market Size:** The global swaps market is over **$400 trillion** in notional value!

# Part 3: Options Deep Dive

## Options: The Right, Not the Obligation

### The Analogy: A Non-Refundable Deposit on a House 🏠

You want to buy a house worth $500,000, but need 3 months to arrange financing. You pay the seller a $10,000 **option fee** to "lock in" the price.

```
HOUSE OPTION EXAMPLE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You pay: $10,000 today (the "premium")
You get: The RIGHT to buy the house at $500,000 in 3 months

SCENARIO A: House value rises to $600,000
- You exercise your option
- Buy at $500,000, instantly worth $600,000
- Profit: $100,000 - $10,000 premium = $90,000 ✅

SCENARIO B: House value falls to $400,000
- You DON'T exercise (why buy at $500K if worth $400K?)
- You lose your $10,000 premium
- Loss: $10,000 (but saved from $100,000 loss!) ✅

SCENARIO C: You change your mind
- You don't HAVE to buy
- You just lose your $10,000 premium

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## Options Terminology Explained

| Term | Definition | Analogy |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Premium** | Price paid for the option | The reservation fee |
| **Strike Price** | Price at which you can buy/sell | The agreed house price |
| **Expiration Date** | When the option expires | Reservation deadline |
| **Underlying** | The asset the option is based on | The house itself |
| **In-the-Money (ITM)** | Option has intrinsic value | House worth more than your price |
| **Out-of-the-Money (OTM)** | Option has no intrinsic value | House worth less than your price |
| **At-the-Money (ATM)** | Strike = Current price | House worth exactly your price |

### In/Out/At the Money Examples

```
Stock trading at: $100

CALL OPTIONS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Strike $90  → IN-THE-MONEY (ITM) ✅
              You can buy at $90, sell at $100 = $10 value

Strike $100 → AT-THE-MONEY (ATM) ➖
              Break-even territory

Strike $110 → OUT-OF-THE-MONEY (OTM) ❌
              Why buy at $110 when market is $100?

PUT OPTIONS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Strike $110 → IN-THE-MONEY (ITM) ✅
              You can sell at $110, buy at $100 = $10 value

Strike $100 → AT-THE-MONEY (ATM) ➖

Strike $90  → OUT-OF-THE-MONEY (OTM) ❌
              Why sell at $90 when market is $100?

## Complete Options Example

### Apple (AAPL) Call Option

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
AAPL CALL OPTION ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Current Stock Price: $180
Option Type: CALL
Strike Price: $185
Expiration: 30 days
Premium: $5.00 per share
Contract Size: 100 shares

TOTAL COST: $5.00 × 100 = $500

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENARIO ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

If AAPL = $200 at expiration:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Intrinsic Value: $200 - $185 = $15 per share                │

## The Greeks: Measuring Option Risk

> **The Greeks tell you HOW an option's price will change** when something else changes

| Greek | Symbol | Measures | Analogy |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| **Delta** | Δ | Price change per $1 stock move | Speedometer |
| **Gamma** | Γ | How fast delta changes | Acceleration |
| **Theta** | Θ | Time decay per day | Melting ice |
| **Vega** | V | Sensitivity to volatility | Sensitivity to weather |
| **Rho** | ρ | Sensitivity to interest rates | Sensitivity to inflation |

### Delta Explained

```
DELTA (Δ): How much option moves per $1 stock move
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Call Option with Delta = 0.50

Stock goes UP $1:
- Option price goes UP $0.50

Stock goes DOWN $1:
- Option price goes DOWN $0.50

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DELTA RANGES:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CALLS: 0 to +1.0                                        │
│ PUTS: -1.0 to 0                                         │
│                                                         │
│ Deep ITM Call: Delta ≈ 0.90 (moves almost like stock)   │
│ ATM Call: Delta ≈ 0.50 (moves half as much)             │
│ Deep OTM Call: Delta ≈ 0.10 (barely moves)              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Theta (Time Decay)

```
THETA: Options LOSE value every day (time decay)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Option Price: $5.00
Theta: -$0.10

Tomorrow (all else equal):
Option Price: $5.00 - $0.10 = $4.90

# Part 5: Real-World Examples

## Case Study 1: Goldman Sachs Market Making

### How Market Making Works

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MARKET MAKING: Being the "House" for Options
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Goldman Sachs makes markets in Apple options:

               BID                    ASK
              $4.95 ◄────SPREAD────► $5.05
              
              "We'll BUY             "We'll SELL
               at $4.95"              at $5.05"

Client A wants to BUY → Pays $5.05 to Goldman
Client B wants to SELL → Gets $4.95 from Goldman

Goldman's profit: $5.05 - $4.95 = $0.10 per share
                  × 100 shares per contract
                  × thousands of contracts per day
                  = Millions in revenue

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE CATCH: Goldman now has RISK

After Client A buys:
- Goldman is SHORT the call option
- If Apple stock rockets up, Goldman loses money!

HEDGING:
- Goldman buys Apple stock (delta hedge)
- Continuously adjusts as price moves
- Goal: Capture the spread, minimize directional risk

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Case Study 2: JP Morgan Structured Product

### Autocallable Note Example

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
JP MORGAN AUTOCALLABLE NOTE ON S&P 500
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PRODUCT SUMMARY:
Investment: $100,000
Term: 2 years
Reference: S&P 500 (starting level: 5,000)
Coupon: 10% per year (if conditions met)
Autocall Barrier: 100% (at or above starting level)
Protection Barrier: 70% (lose principal if breached)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

HOW IT WORKS:

Month 6, 12, 18 (Observation Dates):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ IF S&P 500 ≥ 5,000 (100%):                                      │
│   → Note AUTOCALLS (terminates early)                           │
│   → You get: Principal + 10% × (months held / 12)               │
│                                                                 │
│ IF S&P 500 < 5,000:                                             │
│   → Note continues to next observation                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Month 24 (Final Maturity):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ IF S&P 500 ≥ 3,500 (70% barrier):                               │
│   → You get: Principal back ($100,000)                          │
│   → Plus: Accrued coupons if any triggered                      │
│                                                                 │
│ IF S&P 500 < 3,500 (barrier breached):                          │
│   → You get: Principal × (Final Level / 5,000)                  │
│   → Example: S&P at 3,000 → $100,000 × 0.60 = $60,000 😱        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHY CLIENTS BUY THIS:
✅ 10% coupon in a low-yield environment
✅ 30% downside buffer
✅ Monthly income potential

WHY IT'S RISKY:
❌ Can lose significant principal if market crashes
❌ Capped upside (miss out if market soars)
❌ Complexity hides true risk

## Case Study 3: The 2008 Credit Derivatives Crisis

### What Happened with Credit Default Swaps

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
2008: WHEN DERIVATIVES WENT WRONG
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP (CDS): Insurance against bond defaults

Normal Use:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Bank owns $100M in corporate bonds                              │
│ Worried company might default                                   │
│ Buys CDS protection → Pays small premium                        │
│ If default → CDS seller pays Bank the $100M                     │
│                                                                 │
│ Like fire insurance for your bond portfolio                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

What Went Wrong:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Banks bought CDS on mortgage bonds they didn't own           │
│    (Speculation, not hedging)                                   │
│                                                                 │
│ 2. AIG sold $500+ BILLION in CDS protection                     │
│    (Without enough capital to back it up)                       │
│                                                                 │
│ 3. When mortgages defaulted en masse:                           │
│    - Everyone wanted AIG to pay up                              │
│    - AIG couldn't pay → Needed $180B government bailout         │
│    - Lehman Brothers collapsed                                  │
│    - Global financial crisis                                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

LESSON:
Derivatives are tools. Like a chainsaw:
- Used properly → Incredibly useful
- Used recklessly → Catastrophic

## Case Study 4: GameStop 2021 - Options Gamma Squeeze

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
GAMESTOP JANUARY 2021: Options Gone Wild
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE SETUP:
- GameStop (GME) trading around $20
- Heavy short interest (hedge funds betting it would fall)
- Reddit's r/WallStreetBets starts buying calls

THE MECHANICS:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Step 1: Retail traders buy massive amounts of call options      │
│                                                                 │
│ Step 2: Market makers who sold calls need to hedge              │
│         They buy GME stock (delta hedging)                      │
│                                                                 │
│ Step 3: Buying pressure pushes stock UP                         │
│                                                                 │
│ Step 4: As stock rises, call deltas increase (gamma)            │
│         Market makers must buy MORE stock                       │
│                                                                 │
│ Step 5: More buying → Higher price → More buying                │
│         GAMMA SQUEEZE! 🚀                                       │
│                                                                 │
│ Step 6: Short sellers forced to buy to cover losses             │
│         SHORT SQUEEZE on top of GAMMA SQUEEZE!                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

THE RESULT:
GME: $20 → $483 (in about 2 weeks)
Some retail traders: Made millions
Some hedge funds: Lost billions (Melvin Capital)
Trading platforms: Restricted buying (controversy)
